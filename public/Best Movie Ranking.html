<h1>Best Movies according to Darren</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Man of Steel</h3>
<p>I pretty much love Superman.
It was one of the most decent Superman movie since Christopher Reeves. And Henry Cavill played the role very well</p>
<h3>Afro Samurai</h3>
<p>I like feudal type of genres. Samurai interests me alot. And the Animation is awesome</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>Animators put in alot of efforts to nail the results<br />
Great story
Again, it talks about Taisho Era Japan</p>
